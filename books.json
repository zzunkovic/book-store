    "description": "Gerrardsville, Colorado. One tragic event. Two witnesses. Two conflicting accounts. One witness sees a woman throw herself in front of a bus - clearly suicide. The other witness is Jack Reacher. And he sees what really happened - a man in grey hoodie and jeans, swift and silent as a shadow, pushing the victim to her death, before grabbing her bag and sauntering away. Reacher follows the killer, not knowing that this was no random act of violence. It is part of something much bigger...a sinister, secret conspiracy, with powerful people on the take, enmeshed in an elaborate plot that leaves no room for error. If any step is compromised, the threat will have to be quickly and permanently removed. But when the threat is Reacher, there is No Plan B...",

Like a fanatical tide of corrupted blood, it seethes across the land, devouring all who fail to heed the Word of its elusive prophet, the Pannion Seer. In its path stands an uneasy alliance- Dujek Onearm's Host and the Bridgeburners - each now outlawed by the Empress - alongside their enemies of old including the grim forces of Warlord Caladan Brood, Anomander Rake, Son of Darkness, and his Tiste Andii, and the Rhivi people of the Plains. But more ancient clans too are gathering. As if in answer to some primal summons, the massed ranks of the undead T'lan Imass have risen. For it would seem something altogether darker and more malign threatens the very substance of this world. The Warrens are poisoned and rumours abound of the Crippled God, now unchained and intent on a terrible revenge... Marking the return of many favourite characters from GARDENS OF THE MOON and introducing a host of remarkable new players, MEMORIES OF ICE is a thrilling new chapter in Erikson's magnificent epic fantasy and another triumph of storytelling.",

His father, Vladek, was a Polish Jew sent to Auschwitz during the Second World War. In Maus, Art Spiegelman tells the true story of his father's experiences in stark illustrations that portray the brutality of the Nazis in a non-sensationalist way. It's also the story of how Maus itself came to be; Art Spigelman includes the story of how he interviewed his father, pushing him to remember events he had long tried to forget. Maus is not only a story of survival, it's a story of survivor guilt. The harrowing experiences Vladek went through shaped his life, leading to an often antagonistic relationship with his son Art. Maus is a powerful reminder that the traumas of the Holocaust affect more than those who lived through it.",

Everyone had expected the party to be in the newspapers the next day but not because one of the hosts was murdered! As the crowd had gathered to watch Eliza sing, Fitzhugh had raised a final toast to his glamorous wife and fallen to the floor. Death by cyanide poisoning. It's time for Lt. Eve Dallas to make her entrance. From all accounts, Fitzhugh wasn't the kind of star who made enemies. Eliza, on the other hand, had many rivals, and a few of them could class as enemies. Since the champagne cocktail that killed Brant was originally intended for Eliza, could it be that she was the real target? With so many people at the party, Eve has her work cut out determining who could commit murder in the middle of a crowd. As one who's not fond of the spotlight, she dreads the media circus surrounding a case like this. All she wants is to figure out who's truly innocent, and who's only acting that way...",

In the clubs of Soho, peers of the realm rub shoulders with starlets, foreign dignitaries with gangsters, and girls sell dances for a shilling a time. At the heart of this glittering world is notorious Nellie Coker, ruthless but also ambitious to advance her six children, including the enigmatic eldest, Niven whose character has been forged in the crucible of the Somme. But success breeds enemies, and Nellie's empire faces threats from without and within. For beneath the dazzle of Soho's gaiety, there is a dark underbelly, a world in which it is all too easy to become lost. With her unique Dickensian flair, Kate Atkinson brings together a glittering cast of characters in a truly mesmeric novel that captures the uncertainty and mutability of life; of a world in which nothing is quite as it seems.",

She's come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up ? she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.    Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily, but Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his no dating rule, she can't help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan ? her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. ",

She is passionate and strong, a woman who has it all and wants more, but her professional success and fearlessness are a foil to her vulnerability and inner demons. Outwardly Ava is confident and successful, yet she feels alone in the world. Naked in Mayfair follows Ava's uninhibited sexual odyssey as she is courted by many fascinating men. She loves sex, and her intense sexuality is her expression of a desire to find true love and connection. But whilst Ava has an amusing and pleasurable life, she is damaged inside, and the deep love she yearns for eludes her until finally, she finds purpose and peace in the most unexpected way. Sometimes shocking, often hilarious, always thought-provoking, Naked in Mayfair gives us an illuminating glimpse behind closed doors, in the back of a Bentley and at 30,000 feet. This is a glittering world of privilege and wealth, with extravagant holidays, fine dining and mega yachts. It gives us a unique insight into the secret life of a 21st-century woman's unwavering search for love, meaning, inner peace ? and ultimately, self-acceptance.",

    "description": "There are many rules a priest can't break. A priest cannot marry. A priest cannot abandon his flock. A priest cannot forsake his God. Tyler Bell has had no problem playing by the rules for the last three years after a family tragedy set him on the path to priesthood. That all changes when the delicious, sultry voice of Poppy Danforth sinks its claws in him through the screen of his confessional booth, and he can't get her sins out of his head. It should be easy to put his impure thoughts of her to rest, considering the vows Tyler has taken. It should be nothing to overcome what the sight and sound of her does to him, when his life with the Church means everything. But once he has his first forbidden taste of those red lips, Tyler can't help but break all his rules for Poppy-no matter what it might cost them both.",

Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general - also known as her tough-as-talons mother - has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.  But when you're smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away . . . because dragons don't bond to 'fragile' humans. They incinerate them. With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success.

    "description": "February 13, 2082, First Contact. Sixty-two thousand objects of unknown origin plunge into Earth's atmosphere ? a perfect grid of falling stars screaming across the radio spectrum as they burn. Not even ashes reach the ground. Three hundred and sixty degrees of global surveillance: something just took a snapshot. And then... nothing. But from deep space, whispers. Something out there talks ? but not to us. Two ships, Theseus and the Crown of Thorns, are launched to discover the origin of Earth's visitation, one bound for the outer dark of the Kuiper Belt, the other for the heart of the Solar System. Their crews can barely be called human, what they will face certainly can't. 'A tour de force, redefining the First Contact story for good' Charles Stross. 'If you only read one science fiction novel this year, make it this one!... It puts the whole of the rest of the genre in the shade... It deserves to walk away with the Clarke, the Hugo, the Nebula, the BSFA, and pretty much any other genre award for which it's eligible. It's off the scale... F**king awesome!' Richard Morgan.",

The Warmaster's horde advances through the fire and ash of Terra's dying breaths, forcing the loyalists back to the Delphic Battlement, the very walls of the Sanctum Imperialis. Angron, Herald of Horus, has achieved immortality through annihilation ? now he leads the armies of the damned in a wrathful tide, destroying all before them as the warp begins its poisonous corruption of Terra. For the Emperor's beleaguered forces, the end has come. The Khan lies on the edge of death. Rogal Dorn is encircled, fighting his own war at Bhab Bastion. Guilliman will not reach Terra in time.

    "description": "The decades that followed, up to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, were a complex, vibrant period of artistic questioning, searching, risk-taking and innovation. Concentrating on this period of great upheaval, this book will explore the constructive dialogue between painting and sculpture, and the influential roles played by three giants of the era, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh, across European art as a whole. While acknowledging the centrality of Paris as a cultural capital, it will also uniquely highlight other centres of artistic ferment in Europe, from Brussels and Barcelona to Berlin and Vienna, and track the variety of routes into modernism in the early twentieth century.",

As an adult, he trained as a solicitor and moved to London. Though he was doing pretty well (the South London Press once crowned him 'The Cockroach King' after a successful verdict), a chance encounter in a pub in the 1980s with a young comedian going by the name Vic Reeves set his life on a different track. And now, six years on, the heart condition that once threatened his career has instead led to new success on BBC2's Gone Fishing.",

    "description": "IThe first book to make use of recently released government files detailing the men who got away with the Great Train Robbery. In the early hours of Thursday 8 August 1963, sixteen masked men ambushed the Glasgow-Euston mail train at Sears Crossing in Buckinghamshire. Making off with a record haul of £2.6 million, the robbers received approximately £150,000 each (over £2 million in today's money). While twelve of the robbers were jailed over the next five years, four were never brought to justice. They evaded arrest and 30-year prison sentences, and lived out the rest of their lives in freedom. In stark contrast to the likes of Ronnie Biggs, Buster Edwards and Bruce Reynolds, they became neither household names nor tabloid celebrities. A small team of accomplices who helped execute the crime, before and after the fact, also evaded 25-year prison terms for conspiracy to rob, and likewise lived the remainder of their lives in freedom. Now that these mystery figures, who managed to hide in plain sight for six decades, are dead, the truth about them and indeed about the Great Train Robbery itself can at last be told. AUTHOR: Andrew Cook is an author and TV consultant. He has written for The Times, Guardian, Independent, BBC History Magazine and History Today. His previous books include On His Majesty's Secret Service (Tempus, 2002); Ace of Spies (Tempus, 2003); M: MI5's First Spymaster (Tempus, 2006); The Great Train Robbery (THP, 2013); and 1963: That Was the Year That Was (THP, 2013). 20 b/w illustrations",

Before posthumously skyrocketing to global fame, she had so deeply buried her past that even the families she lived with knew little about her. No one could relay where she was born or raised, if she had parents or siblings, if she enjoyed personal relationships, why she took photographs and why she didn't share them with others. Now, in this ?thorough, fascinating overview of an artist working for art's sake? (The New York Times), Ann Marks uses her complete access to Vivian's personal records and archive of 140,000 photographs to reveal the full story of her extraordinary life.",

Easy to say, hard to practice - and if it was tough in 300 BC, or in the 1940s, it feels all but impossible today. Yet it's the most empowering and important virtue any of us can learn. Without self-discipline, all our plans fall apart. Here, Ryan Holiday shows how to cultivate willpower, moderation and self-control in our lives. From Aristotle and Marcus Aurelius, to Toni Morrison and Queen Elizabeth II, he illuminates the great exemplars of its practice and what we can learn from them. Moderation is not about abstinence: it is about self-respect, focus and balance. Without it, even the most positive traits become vices. But with it, happiness and success are assured: the key is not more but finding the right amount.",

But what if it held a more radical potential that was waiting to be unlocked? By moving past simply equating the blockchain with cryptocurrency and instead trying to understand what these tools do and how they work, Blockchain Radicals shows how the blockchain can be used by a left that is in need of new ideas in its struggle to create a better world for all. Steering between boosters on the right and cynics on the left, it shows us how the blockchain is a space where new post-capitalist strategies and collectives are already emerging.",

The book's up-to-date approach is a far cry from the dry instructions and dated artwork that feature in more traditional art books. In contrast to other, project-orientated titles, Drawing and Painting places the emphasis on the techniques themselves, encompassing drawing, sketching and a range of painting styles. From pen and ink to oils and acrylics, specially commissioned photography and artwork accompanies step-by-step techniques, while profiles of contemporary artists provide insight into various working methods, materials and techniques.",

Combining the latest research with his own hands-on, clinical experience, van der Kolk advocates against the dependence on drugs to treat PTSD and instead argues for the treatment of the whole person, not just the mind. Highlighting the importance of listening to and getting in touch with our emotions, instead of trying to shut out the negative, practical suggestions like talking therapy, yoga, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitisation Therapy are discussed as a way to overcome trauma rather than block it out. Arguing for the de-stigmatisation of acknowledging trauma and the treatment of it, van der Kolk's The Body Keeps The Score is a groundbreaking look at the future of mental health treatment, one of the most urgent public health concerns in recent years.",

Taking in the Victorian moralism of the Thatcher years, the far-reaching restrictions of the Criminal Justice Act in 1994, and the resurgence of illegal raves during the Covid-19 pandemic, Party Lines charts an ongoing conflict, fought in basement clubs, abandoned warehouses and sunlit fields, between the revolutionary potential of communal sound and the reactionary impulses of the British establishment.

In The Story of Russia, Orlando Figes brings into sharp relief the vibrant characters that comprise Russia's rich history, and whose stories remain so important in making sense of the world's largest nation today ? from the crowning of sixteen-year-old Ivan the Terrible in a candlelit cathedral, to Catherine the Great, riding out in a green uniform to arrest her husband at his palace, to the bitter last days of the Romanovs.",

    "description": "Exploring the latest archaeological findings and recent scientific analysis of Doggerland's underwater remains, Graham Phillips shows that this ancient culture had sophisticated technology and advanced medical knowledge. He looks at evidence detected with remote sensing and seismic profiling of many artificial structures, complex settlements, gigantic earthworks, epic monoliths, and huge stone circles dated to more than 5,500 years ago, preserved beneath the ground and on the ocean floor. He examines evidence of Doggerland's high-temperature technology, showing how its people were able to melt solid rock to create vitrified structures far stronger than concrete, a technique that modern science cannot replicate. He looks at the small part of the Fairland land mass that still exists: Fair Isle, a tiny island some 45 miles north of the Orkney Islands of Scotland. Phillips shows how, when Fairland sank beneath the waves around 3100 BC, its last survivors traveled by boat to settle in the British Isles, where they established the megalithic culture that built Stonehenge.",

In this remarkable portrait of a revolutionary age, Daisy Hay captures a changing nation through the stories of the men and women who wrote it into being, and whose ideas still influence us today.",

The humanity and wit revealed in Seneca's interpretation of Stoicism is a moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind.",

In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie - man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. The book argues that human civilisation is a defence against the knowledge that we are mortal beings. Becker states that humans live in both the physical world and a symbolic world of meaning, which is where our 'immortality project' resides. We create in order to become immortal - to become part of something we believe will last forever. In this way we hope to give our lives meaning.",

In Lessons in Stoicism, philosopher John Sellars weaves together the key ideas of the three great Roman Stoics - Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius - with snapshots of their fascinating lives, to show us how their ideas can help us today. In vivid prose, Sellars shows how the works of these three Stoics have inspired readers ever since, speaking as they do to some of the perennial issues that face anyone trying to navigate their way through life. Their works, fundamentally, are about how to live - how to understand one's place in the world, how to cope when things don't go well, how to manage one's emotions and how to behave towards others.",

    "description": "Dancing doesn't just refract the music and culture within which it evolves; it also generates new music and culture in and of itself. When we speak only of the music, we lose part of the story - the part that finds us dancing as children on the toes of adults; the half that triggers egalitarian communication across borders and languages; the part that finds us worried that we'll never be able to dance again, and the part that finds us wondering why we were ever nervous in the first place.",

Building a home, travelling alone, choosing whether to be a mother, recognising her own milestones, learning the limits of self-care and the expansive potential of self-friendship, Key uncovers the many forms of connection and care that often go unnoticed.",

    "description": "Forged in a West London fire ritual in 1979 and reborn with their original line-up in 2008, Killing Joke have been creating uncompromising music for 44 years. In addition to their incandescent self-titled debut in 1980, they have released essential albums in each of the past four decades: Night Time (1985), Pandemonium (1994), Killing Joke (2003) and Pylon (2015). But Killing Joke are more than a band; they are a primal force that exerts an intangible gravity on both its members and its fans. They have influenced countless groups across multiple genres - including Metallica, Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails - while their own style ranges across post-punk, dub, industrial, world music, electronica and alt-metal. Their equally eclectic lyrics traverse social alienation, dystopian futures, the folly of hubris, Cold War dread, paganism and the occult. Above all, their work embodies a process of self-discovery whose aim is nothing less than the revelation and integration of our darkest urges. Killing Joke On Track covers the 15 studio albums and almost 200 songs of Killing Joke's vocation to date. It's a celebration of a band who are often challenging.",

From the stories behind unusual street names, to the trees in our parks; railings made from recycled WWII stretchers, to shrapnel damage on walls; the hidden symbols on post boxes, to prehistoric tree trunks ? there is a rich history hidden in the oft-overlooked details of the city's streets, gardens, parks and buildings. This richly detailed and beautifully illustrated book provides a miscellany of historic features and curiosities to spot as you wander around the capital. Whether you've always wondered why there are cattle troughs on your route to work, why bollards often look like upside down cannons or wanted to know what a Victorian stink pipe is ? this book will provide the tools to decipher London's secret code, and introduce you to a treasure trove of hidden spots to explore.",

Suzanne fought her parents, longing to return to England and to education and stability.

    "description": "The content has been developed around themes that showcase all of the Museum galleries. Each theme contains a series of questions - What is a dinosaur? How old is the Earth? What is the smallest part of you? - that can be explored within the galleries. The book also goes beyond the galleries to explore behind the scenes at the Museum including what our scientists do, what's in our collections and why they are so useful. This fun, interactive guide incorporates the latest Museum map and can be dipped into as necessary, or used to follow a route through the galleries. Kids Only aims to support family visits and facilitate children's learning and enjoyment in the galleries and beyond. It is complemented by the Museum website and will make the Museum more accessible to those unable to visit.",

The waiter inhabits a world of inhuman hours, snatched sleep and dive bars; scraping by on coffee, bread and cigarettes, often under sadistic managers, with a wage so low you're fighting your colleagues for tips. It's physically demanding, frequently humiliating and incredibly competitive. And with a cast of thieves, narcissists, ex-Legionnaires, paperless immigrants and drug dealers, it makes for a compelling and eye-opening read.",

    "description": "An accessible, warm-hearted story, written by an adoptive parent, centred around two young bears who find themselves out in the cold, alone, and begin their journey to being adopted into a forever family. The story acknowledges the mix of emotions children being adopted can feel - the fear and worry, as well as the joy of experiencing love and kindness from their new carers. With appealing animal characters and beautiful illustrations, The Blanket Bears offers an honest yet gentle account of the complete adoption journey for children starting or trying to understand the process. It's also a great introduction to young children more widely about how the process of adoption works and how some families come to be together. In order the strike the right balance of accuracy and sensitivity for young readers, the author consulted and collaborated with professionals and psycholigists as well as drawing on the lived experiences of his children. Many children's books about adoption focus purely on adapting into the new family but this has a more holistic and realistic focus, all from a child's perspective.",
